# CrystalCare

A dynamic sound healing application that generates evolving, spiral-based tones to balance, empower, protect, and energetically heal. Inspired by ancient vibrational practices and built with modern mathematical modeling, CrystalCare creates immersive soundscapes that go beyond static binaural beats or isochronic tones.

## Disclaimer

CrystalCare operates outside the framework of conventional linear-based science. It is a non-linear, energetic tool designed to balance, empower, protect, and energetically heal through vibrational frequencies and sacred geometry. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any medical condition. CrystalCare is offered as a complementary practice rooted in ancient sound healing traditions and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice or treatment.

## How It Works

CrystalCare fuses ancient sound healing principles with advanced mathematical and audio processing:

- **Mathematical Spirals** - Logarithmic spirals for harmonious natural growth patterns combined with Rossler attractor perturbations for chaotic, non-linear depth
- **Golden Ratio & Sacred Geometry** - Frequencies incorporate PHI (1.618), Solfeggio tunings, and sacred ratios for natural harmonic resonance
- **Sacred Frequency Layers** - Three hidden healing layers activate in longer sessions: Pleroma Mercy, Silent Solfeggio Grid, and Archon Dissolution
- **3D Spatial Audio** - Hybrid spiral panning and spatialized triple helix create immersive, evolving soundscapes
- **Dynamic Generation** - Every session is unique with fractal noise modulation, evolving envelopes, and quantum harmonic interference

## Modes

CrystalCare offers seven frequency modes:

| Mode | Frequencies | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Lower Frequencies** | 174, 396, 417, 528 Hz | Grounding, clearing negativity, emotional release |
| **Higher Frequencies** | 852, 963 Hz | Spiritual awakening, intuition |
| **Atlantean Cosmic** | 136.10, 194.18, 211.44, 303 Hz | Planetary resonance, cosmic alignment |
| **Combined Mode** | Sacred Geometry + Flower of Life ratios | Holistic balance, comprehensive healing |
| **Triple Helix DNA Activation** | DNA-inspired ratios (1.0, 1.2, 1.4) | Deep activation, unconscious rewiring |
| **Taygetan Resonances** | Binaural sync pairs based on sacred constants (sqrt(2), e, pi, PHI) | DNA activation with stereo binaural beating |
| **Dimensional Journey** | Cycles through all frequency sets in phases | 1D-9D realignment, multidimensional traversal |

## Features

- Real-time playback with evolving tones
- WAV export for offline listening
- Batch save for generating multiple sessions
- Accessible interface with screen reader support (wxPython + NVDA compatible)
- Optimized performance (22.9x faster than realtime generation)

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- NumPy, SciPy, Numba, sounddevice, wxPython

### Setup

```bash
conda create -n cc python=3.10 -y
conda activate cc
pip install numpy scipy numba sounddevice wxPython
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Run

```bash
python main.py
```

Or use the included `run.bat` on Windows.

### Build Standalone Executable

```bash
pip install nuitka
build.bat
```

## Usage Tips

- Use headphones for full 3D immersion
- Set intentions before sessions
- Combine with breathwork or visualization for deeper effects
- Sessions of 60+ seconds activate the sacred frequency layers
- Longer sessions (10-60 minutes) recommended for full benefit
